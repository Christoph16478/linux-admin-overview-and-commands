# what is [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

* founded 1992 by Linux Torvalds based on [minix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix)
* strongly oriented at the [unix-architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_architecture) and is called a [unix-derivat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)
* linux is a fre rela multi-user os
    * simlutaneously multiple users at the same system
* most components or under the [gnu public license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
* linux is running as a so called [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_embedded_systems) on routers, firewalls, smartphones, tablets, etc.
* [linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) is written in [c programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_C_Programming_Language)

# open source licensing

* gnu gpl allows to change, execute, change, distribute and study the software
* changes, development and further development must be licensed again under gnu
* gpl does not forbid commercial usage
* there are fre community editions and commercial enterprise editions
* there are a lot of optional componentes, with different license
    * e.g. driver for graphic cards
* [bsd licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) are 'permissive' open source licenses
    * Derivations and extensions may be placed under more restrictive licenses
    * product developed on the BSD license may also be [closed source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software)

# user management

linux is a multiuser system: Several users can use the system, even simultaneously. each user usually has his own user account. mandatory is a user name with which the user logs on to the system. this name must be unique on the system. linux generally distinguishes betwen upper and lower case, this also applies to the
user names. the UID, i.e. the user ID, must also be unique and is normally assigned automatically by the system.
automatically
* special users have IDs below 1000, root e.g. always has ID 0
* normal users get an ID from 1000 upwards.
Users are given a login shell. this is the environment that is provided for them, when they log in to the console. dash stands for Debian almquist Shell and is used as the default shell for Debian derivatives.
* a user is assigned a home directory
    * root has his home directory under /root
    * normal user usually under /home/username
* Settings related to useradd and userdel are defined in the file /etc/login.defs file
* In the file /etc/default/useradd further defaults can be made
(e.g. setting the login shell as default when creating a new user)
* Groups are used to assign access rights to a resource to multiple accounts.
resource
* each user is assigned a main group. By default, a group with the same name and
group with the same name and ID as the user's group.
* alternatively, all users are assigned the same main group called users. It usually has
ID 100, but this is not as flexible, so on most systems users get their own group by default.
systems users get their own group by default
* Users can be members of more than one group and are sometimes automatically
assigned to certain additional groups
* the command usermod supports almost all options that are also provided by useradd. Unfortunately
the option -m does not work like with useradd. therefore the home directory
must be copied manually, and the access rights must be set accordingly.
* there are several system users. Because for security reasons many services of the
system are operated in the context of their own user, whose access rights can be set accordingly.
can be configured accordingly
* "Pseudo shells" like bin/false or /sbin/nologin do not provide an environment, respectively
prevent a user from logging in interactively. This is used as a security feature
to restrict system users to the system itself.
* Change age (chage) displays information from /etc/shadow in a more readable way in the terminal, and can adjust
(also dialog-guided) adjust parameters
* the main group of a user is recorded in /etc/passwd, therefore the user does not appear in
/etc/group again
* If a new group is created, the GID automatically continues counting from the last created ID high
* the program adduser provides a dialog-guided creation of users incl. password is provided
* the deluser program can use the --remove-all-files option to provide the user with delete all files of the user on the whole system
* the behavior of adduser and deluser can be controlled by the tw  * files /etc/adduser.conf and /etc/deluser.conf to customize the behavior of adduser and deluser.

# user management files

* user information is managed in thre files:
    * /etc/passwd
        * Login name
        * UID (user ID)
        * GID (main group ID)
        * GeCOS field (Comment field)
        * Home directory
        * Login shell
    * /etc/shadow
        * Login name
        * Password (as hash)
        * Date of the last password change (days since 1/1/1970)
        * Minimum number of days betwen tw  * password changes
        * Number of days on which a warning is issued about password expiration
        * Number of days until deactivation after the password has expired.
        * Date on which account is automatically deactivated
    * /etc/group
        * Group name
        * Group ID
        * Group members

# working with paths

* the cd command takes paths as parameters. these can be absolute or relative
    * absolute paths
        * Start with a / and describe the path to the desired directory starting from the topmost point in the file system
    * Relative paths

Describe the path to the destination starting from the current location
* the $OLDPwD variable contains the previous directory in which you were located
* to run a program, we have tw  * options:
    * we specify the absolute path in front of it
    * we write ./ in front of it, this stands for the current directory
* If we want to open files, e.g. with an editor, we can directly specify the file if it is located in the same directory

# Create and delete directories

* Under Ubuntu, the .profile file in the home directory specifies which paths are included in the the $PaTH variable
* Under CentOS, the .bash_profile file in the home directory determines which paths are are included in the $PaTH variable
* with mkdir directories are created, with rmdir directories are deleted (only empty directories without subfolders). with the option -p also with subfolders
* the command rm deletes files as well as directories. Be careful when using this command!

# understanding directories listings

* Output of the ls -l command (long format)
  * each file or subdirectory is on a separate line
  * the dot stands for the current directory and the colon for the
parent directory
  * the first column contains the file type
    * d stands for directory, i.e. a directory
    * * stands for normal files
    * l stands for Link, which are symbolic or soft links
    * c for Character Device, these are character-oriented devices (modems)
    * b for Block Device, these are block-oriented devices (storage media)
  * executable files are displayed in gren (based on the rights).
  * the rights are displayed accordingly
  * the number of links to this entry
  * the owner of the entry and the group the entry is assigned to
  * the size of the file is shown in bytes
  * Date of the last modification

# Create, copy, move and delete files

* there are thre common ways to create a file:
  * Create a file with touch
  * Open and save a non-existing file with an editor
  * Create and describe a file with ech  * and the redirect character
* with the command cp (copy) files can be copied (also under another name) with the option
the option -r even complete directories
* with the command mv (move) files can be moved and renamed.
Caution: If the destination is not a directory, but an existing file, this file will be overwritten with the contents of the source file.

  * Hardlinks can exist only within a partition.
  * Hardlinks can be applied only to files, not to directories
  * If a Hardlink is deleted, then the original file still continues to exist
* Softlinks / Symbolic Links, short: Symlinks
  * with Symlinks references, thus links can be created partition-spreading.
  * This applies equally to files and directories
  * they are clearly easier to recognize, since they work with paths
  * If the original file is deleted, no copy exists any more

# archiving and compressing files

* In order to save data and files or to make them available, it is a good idea to pack them in an
archive file as a whole and compress it
* Saves space on the storage medium or bandwidth during transfer
* the most commonly used program for archiving is tar
* a tarball is an archive file created with tar and compressed with gzip or bzip2
* Bzip2(.bz2) and gzip(.gz) are compression methods
* Bzip2 is the newer and more effective variant
* Files with the extension tar are uncompressed archives which can be unpacked with tar -xf.

# Understanding access rights to files and directories

* access rights to files and directories are represented with ls -l:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions)
* This is what the access rights mean:
[https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php#:~:text=On%20a%20Linux%20system%2C%20eachthe%20file%20as%20a%20program](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php#:~:text=On%20a%20Linux%20system%2C%20eachthe%20file%20as%20a%20program)
* Set access rights with chmod:
* User and groups can be set with chown, the command assumes by colon
separates user and group:
  * chown <user>:<group> <file>
* the second way is to use chown to set the user and chgrp to set the group
with chgrp:
  * chown <user> <file>
  * chgrp <group> <file>
* Set access rights with the Octal method: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/e19455-01/805-7229/6j6q8svd8/](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/e19455-01/805-7229/6j6q8svd8/)

# Special rights * SUID bit, SGID bit and sticky bit

* If the user rights of a file are displayed with an S instead of an X, this is the
the Set UID bit or short: SUID bit. It ensures that the program is always executed with the
rights of the file owner
* the SUID bit can be set with chmod u=rwxs <file> or chmod 4755 <file>.
* the SGID bit ensures that a file with execute privileges always runs in the context of the
of the group. For a directory, the set GID bit ensures that the group specified for the
directory is inherited by all newly created subdirectories and files.
are inherited
* we can set the SGID bit with chmod g=rwxs <file> or chmod 2755 <file>.
* the sticky bit is set by a t instead of the x for Others, i.e. at the very end of the
rights list and is used e.g. for the /tmp directory.
* If the sticky bit is applied to a folder * and this is the only purpose * then
files and directories created in it can only be deleted or renamed by the file owner.
renamed
* It is set via the letter t or octal via the 1 in the fourth, preceding
digit

# Umask and the default permissions

* If a directory is created, then certain permissions are set by default:
  * rwx for the user,
  * rx for the group
  * rx for Others
* If a file is created, then certain permissions are set by default:
  * rw for the user,
  * r for the group
  * r for Others
* these default permissions are set with umask
* Since it is a mask, what is hidden, i.e. not set, is displayed
is set:
  * For directories, we subtract the umask from 7 each to get the set values.
are obtained. the first digit is ignored, since it concerns special rights that are not set in the
umask are not set anyway
  * For files the 6 is the initial value
* set umask:
  * For CentOS, system-wide: /etc/profile, for users: .bash_profile
  * For Ubuntu, system-wide: /etc/login.defs, for users: .profile

  * searches in the current folder + all subfolders for all files with the extension .JPG and
deletes them. (case sensitive)
* find /Desktop name "*.JPG" -or -name "*.CR3"
  * searches the desktop for files with the extension JPG and CR3.
* man find
  * Calls the manual of find and displays all parameters

# locate command

* locate creates a database with all files and searches them.
  *find searches the files on the hard disk (Takes longer).
* Database must be kept up to date
If the name of a file has ben changed, it is not automatically in the database and cannot yet be found.
Database and cannot yet be found.
  *By default, the database is updated once a day under Ubuntu.
  *sudo updatedb
    * Command to update the database
* locate "filename"
  *searches for the corresponding file
* locate -i "filename"
  *searches for the corresponding file, upper and lower case is ignored
* locate -i -regex "ubuntu(.*)\.ISO"
  *searches for files that have Ubuntu in the name (or in the path) and end with ISO
* locate -i --regex * basename "ubuntu(.*)\.ISO"
  *searches for files that have Ubuntu in the name(path is ignored here) and end in ISO
end

# Grep, first steps with regular expressions
* with Grep you can search the contents of files grep "money"
  * searches all files in the current folder for money
* grep --count "money" *
  * searches all files in the current folder for money and returns the frequency of the word of the word
* grep -e -i 'Subject:(.*)money' *
  * searches all files in the current folder for Subject: ......money......(ignores upper and upper and lower case)
  * the word to be searched in single quotes because a regular expression is used!
  * (.*) means it doesn't matter how many and which characters come.

# partitioning

* a partition is a logical volume on a physical or virtual hard drive
* advantage: logical partitioning of data, os backed up and restored independently of rest of the data on the disk
* each partition the file system can be defined separately - optimizes performance, so partitions can be administered separately encryption exchange or change of the medium

# file system repairs

* with the classical MBR partitioning a maximum of 4 partitions may be created extended partitions are not managed by the MBR. they can take up arbitrary logical partitions, which makes the limit disappear with the more modern GUID partition table a maximum of 128 partitions are allowed and there are n-differences in the kind of the partitions a swap partition holds data that should be swapped out of the main memory if it becomes tight there
* in the directory /dev are all device files, these refer to the hardware IDe hard disks are named hda, hdb, hdc etc.
* SCSI and SaTa hard disks are designated with sda, sdb, sdc etc.
* the number behind the designation indicates the partition
* the bootflag, recognizable by the asterisk, shows the BIOS or UeFI that it is possible to boot from this harddisk can be booted
* bootflag must be set explicitly during partitioning
* ubuntu does not create a swap partition by default
* MBR-based partitions can be managed with fdisk
* by default fdisk assigns the label 83 to every created partition, change to 82 linux swap

# File systems

* partitions are not yet usable for the operating system in the raw state
* partitions must be formatted with a file system
* journaling captures changes to the file system and can help to bring the file system file system back into a consistent state [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system#Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system#Linux)
* to install XFS filesystem, first of all xfsprogs must be isntalled
* fomrating of file goes hand in hand with total loss of data

```bash
# check filesystem
:~$ fsck
```

```bash
# check filesystem
:~$ fsck
```

* after a certain time, the systems executes a check on the filesystem
* filesystems must be mounted to be used

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)


```bash
# mountpoint can be created
:~$ mount
```

```bash
# mountpoint can be created
:~$ mount
```

* mounting must be done before the bootin of the system
* <code>/etc/fstab</code> provides a list of file systems, mount points, parameters, and options

```bash
# show all mounted filesystems
:~$ df

## part 2

* Order is important
  * Correct:
<code>(date +"%Y" && cat s.txt) > output.txt 2>&1</code>
  * Incorrect:
~~(date +"%Y" && cat s.txt) 2>&1 > output.txt~~
* otherwise the programme output is overwritten and only the error is written in output.txt.

# the exit code of programs

* <code>$?</code>
  * exit variable
  * 0 - program was executed correctly
  * 1 - (rarely also 2 or 3) means an error has occurred
  * variable is overwritten after each executed command
* <code>echo $?</code>
  * outputs the exit variable
  * it can be checked whether the last command was successfully executed

# stdin
* <code>sort</code>
  * entries can be made which are then sorted
  * CTRL + D terminates the input
* <code>sort < name.txt</code>
  * sends the file name.txt to the sort programme
  * name.txt is used as standard input for sort
sort gets name.txt not as a file but as normal input
* <code>sort < name.txt > name-sorted.txt</code>
  * passes the name.txt file to sort and writes the output of the program to name-sorted.txt
* < allows chaining of commands with passing

# | - operator (pipe operator)

* the pipe operator |<
  * <code>ls | sort</code>
passes the output of ls directly to sort
* <code>ls | sort -r</code>
  * passes the output of ls to sort
  * sort reverses the sorting by -r
* | can also be used to pass the output of programs
  * < takes only the contents of a file
  * <code>sort < script.sh</code>
    * sricpt.sh is considered a file
  * <code>./scipt.sh | sort</code>
    * the output of sricpt.sh is passed on
*<code> cat /proc/cpuinf * | grep "model name"</code>
  * the output of cat is passed to grep and searched for model name

# te

* <code>ls | xargs echo</code>
  * xargs converts the standard input from ls into parameters so that ech * can use them. can use them
  * <code>ls | ech *</code> would output nothing
* <code>ls /etc | te output.txt | grep "cron"</code>
  * output of ls is passed to te which then saves it to a file this output is then passed on to grep which searches it for cron
* <code>te -a output.xt</code>
  * output is appended to the file by the parameter -a

# set system time and date
* time is important for several reasons:
  * log entries are dated by means of time stamps
  * authentication processes are partly carried out using time stamps (e.g. Kerberos, certificates)
* Coordinated universal time is called UTC (Universal Time Coordinated), formerly GMT.
* Summer time in Europe is called CeST (Central european Summer Time).
* the date command displays the time and allows you to set the system time stamp
* there is a system time and a hardware time (mainboard)
* <code>hwclock</code> displays the hardware time
* <code>cat /etc/adjtime</code> shows in which time form the hardware time is set, usually UTC
* hardware time and system time can be set and synchronised manually

# time synchronisation with NTP

* ntp (Network Time Protocol) enables automatic time synchronisation with time servers
* ntp distinguishes between stratum values:
  * stratum 0: the time source itself (e.g. atom* or radio clock).
  * stratum 1: Systems that get the time directly from the time source.
  * stratum 2: systems that get the time from stratum 1 servers
  * etc
  * [https://w.ntppool.org/en/](https://w.ntppool.org/en/)

* ubuntu uses a daemon called timesyncd from Systemd to synchronise the time.
* ntpdate can be used to set a time server for NTP, ntpdate is deprecated.
* ntpd is the more modern command, it is configured via /etc/ntp.conf
* ntpd is a daemon that binds to port 123/udp and listens for NTP requests.
* various time servers can be specified via the configuration of NTP server pools.
* if the time deviates, NTP can adjust the time value smoothly - the time then runs faster or slower for a while time runs faster or slower, as the case may be (this avoids errors and time jumps)
* on shutdown, the time daemon overwrites the value of the hardware clock

# system logging

* linux logs mainly to /var/log
* main log files are <code>/var/log/messages</code> (CentOS, SuSe, etc.) or <code>/var/log/syslog</code> (DebianDerivate)
* there are dedicated logfiles for many special events (auth.log, kern.log, btmp and wtmp).
* by default, a ring buffer is used, i.e. the oldest messages are overwritten at some point overwritten
* other components, such as server services, sometimes create their own subdirectories for logging under /var/log their logging under <code>/var/log</code>
* log entries are usually in plain text (btmp and wtmp as well as the systemd journal are exceptions). are exceptions)
* the ccze programme allows log entries to be coloured.

# understanding the syslog concept

* [syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) is an old standard supported by many systems
* syslog messages have a specific structure:
  * origin(facility)
  * severity
  * event
* the syslog daemon [rsyslogd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsyslog) is the most common under Linux, it is configured in <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf.</code> configured

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog

# Configure the syslog daemon

* rsyslogd runs as a daemon in the context of the syslog user
* <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf</code> is the main configuration file, which mainly includes files under <code>/etc/rsyslog.d</code>
* under Ubuntu, the file /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf is included, which contains the main entries.
* this may be regulated differently on other distributions
* on CentOS, these rules are contained directly in <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf.</code>

# Configure remote logging

* in rsyslog.conf the module imudp or imtcp must be activated
* by default port 514/udp is used
* on the syslog client, an entry is created in the rules in /etc/rsyslog.conf whose action contains @<server-address>

# use logrotate

* the logrotate programme can be used to rotate log files.
* logrotate does not run as a service, but is started by Systemd (Ubuntu) or crond (CentOS). started
* the configuration of logrotate can be found in <code>/etc/logrotate.conf.</code>
* It contains settings for the rotation cycle, the number of backlogs to be cancelled, and so on.
<code>/etc/logrotate.d/</code> may contain further files for configuring certain components of the system, e.g. the components of the system, e.g. CUPS or apache2

# the systemd journal

* the [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) journal is a second log level, Systemd logs in parallel to Syslog.
* the service responsible for this is journald
* the journal can be displayed via the command journalctl

# DNS with dig & Co. Testing

* linux implements the nameservice switch, or nsswitch for short, a concept which the basic resolution of names into numerical values: configuration file: <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>
* there are various components, such as <code>passwd</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>shadow</code>, <code>hosts</code> or <code>protocols</code>, that require resolution to numeric values
* for user administration using passwd, group, etc., the corresponding files are first corresponding files are consulted first, as * e.g. <code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/etc/group</code> or <code>/etc/shadow</code>
* if no resolution can be made there, a systemd mechanism may be asked for shared libraries regulate how this is addressed.
* for host names, the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file is queried first.
* as a rule, the hosts file is always queried before the DNS mechanism, entries can be made here, the name resolution of which can be freely selected.
* after this comes mdns4_minimal, mDNS stands for Multicast DNS and is a special, newer service which
service that attempts to resolve DNS names via multicast in the local network.

```bash
# Get entity and enables the targeted reading of an entry from one of the
# from one of the administrative database files, such as passwd, hosts, etc.
:~$ getent
```

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup)

```bash
# change the query type and ask for mailserver (mx) or the name server (ns)
:~$ host -t
```

```bash
# queries for a records by default
:~$ dig
```

```bash
# dig does not automatically reverse-resolve, you need to set the -x option
:~$ dig @192.168.1.254 -x 8.8.8.8
```

# set the hostname

```bash
# show hostname
:~$ hostname or uname -u
```

```bash
# complete hostname with domain and toplevel domain
:~$ hostname -f
```

```bash
# set hostname
:~$ systemctl set-hostname "Name"
```

* even if an entry has been created in the /etc/hosts file, other systems in the network can use this name network can use this name

* the cups configuration is located in <code>/etc/cups</code>
* In the <code>printers.conf</code> file, which we can only open as admin, we can see the configured printers with their settings.
* main configuration file for this process is <code>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</code>

* concept based on [HTTP 1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)
* http header contains the dns name
* name resolution must be set up
* vonfiguration of a VirtualHost under Ubuntu:
* In the directory /etc/apache2/sites-available, a new file is created for webpresenceÂ´create:
  * e.g. 001-gulugulu.conf:
  * <VirtualHost *:80> * creates a VirtualHost section.
  * ServerName w.gulugulu.local * defines the DNS name that must be in the must be in the host header
  * Serveralias gulugulu.local * defines further aliases on which the server should respond to
  * DocumentRoot /var/w/gulugulu * Directory for content of the web presence set

  * If the IP is entered directly, the specific VirtualHost is also displayed. Better is to create another VirtualHost configuration without ServerName directive, to create a default web presence here

# basics of mail communication

[Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email)

# setup mailserver postfix

* Mail server systems usually consist of various components and are comparable to web platforms
* all linux systems used sendmail, one of its successor is [postfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)) (others are [qmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qmail) or [exim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim))
* nowadays, the Internet often only accepts mail from mail servers with an appropriate reputation reputation. the sending of mails by a self-created mail server is therefore often rejected
  * For this reason, many internal mail servers send their mails to a mail server of the provider (smarthost), which has a corresponding reputation and sends the mails to the addressee.

```bash
# list of all available configuration options of postfix
:~$ postconf
```

* the configuration files for Postfix are located in <code>/etc/postfix</code>
* most important config file = <code>main.cf</code>
* smtpd_relay_restrictions directive determines from which clients mails are forwarded - to prevent unauthorised systems from routing mails through the mail server and turning the mail server into an open relay
* permit_mynetworks option means that all ip addresses and subnetworks contained in the variable <code>mynetworks</code> are allowed to send mails via this mail server

```bash
# lists all domains for which this mail server is responsible
:~$ mydestination
```

```bash
# mail server is restarted
:~$ systemctl restart postfix
```

```bash
# check that postfix is running
:~$ systemctl status postfix
```

# smtp communication via telnet

* perform an SMTP session manually via telnet

```bash
# establishes a connection with the help of Telnet via port 25 (SMTP) with the mail server
:~$ telnet <IP-Mailserver> 25
```

* compose  mail within telnet communication:

> mail from: absender@domian.de
> 
> rcpt to: empfaenger@domain.de
>
> data
> 
> subject: Subject
> 
> text content of the mail, concluded with a dot ("."), composition of mail is a single line

* users' mailboxes are located under <code>/cvar/mail</code>. created as soon as a user receives first e-mail

# configure mail-aliases and redirections

* in <code>/etc/aliases</code>, aliases and forwardings are set up.
* after each change to the aliases file, the command newaliases must be executed.
* mail server must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
* mail program can be installed with

```bash
# (for centos package 'mailx')
:~$ sudo apt-get install mailutils
```

```bash
# initiates creation of a mail by the tool mail
:~$ sudo apt-get install mailutils
```

```bash
# display the current mail queue
:~$ mailq
```
